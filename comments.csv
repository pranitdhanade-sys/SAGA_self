@Alexander-h5s1d,"I use GNU/Linux everyday, and have for months, but I can say that Windows and macOS aren’t bad operating systems; in fact, they’re really good, but the only reason I don’t use either is because of privacy and well… my computer is an old fella, and trying to run Windows 11 on 4 GiB of DDR3 is impossible. It runs way too slow, so, I use GNU/Linux. Windows is great for software, but because of Wine on GNU/Linux I can run all .exe files on my computer. As for macOS? Yeah, no, I’m not using macOS applications. I will say that it’s worth it to try out daily driving Debian or Fedora (GNU/Linux distribution) for a month. You’ll either love it, or hate it, but either way you’ll enjoy it to some degree. Have fun, bro, and enjoy your programming deviousness!

Edit: My reasoning for picking Debian and Fedora is because they’re both really good. Some will say to use Ubuntu, but Ubuntu is just a branch of Debian. Debian runs a TON of stuff. As for Fedora, it’s just so you get taste of something else. However, whatever you do, do NOT pick Arch as your first distribution, you’ll give up quickly unless you use archinstall.",0

If you placed bed into a non-water source but still water block in no light areas on someones claim and the further part of the bed did get adjacent to the crops then you would update state of the crops in lack of light and because you messed with order by the plugin needing one extra tick to recognize that these crops should be unbreakable it broke the order and dropped the crops but also restored them, so you had crop items and the crop blocks too, i managed to put 25 accounts on my ancient cpu all of them glitching it constantly and reselling with the server plugin forever 

I let them go on for the night and i woke up to top money, then i laundered it and got gear to dominate the server with my clan and i kept doing it and never got found out for some reason
On that server you could also claim keys every 12 hours of playtime and there was always a message when somebody opens the chest

another solution for the mouse trick is to keybind the left-click to the number pad, hold down the key, and then turn number lock off. the computer doesn't receive the signal that the key is no longer being pressed. also works for power semi-automation in diablo 3
windows is for normies, linux is for coders (and wannabe coders who hate themselves), and mac is for retards who have too much money
5:40 the redstone for the chicken cooker is too complicated. much easier to do tripwire in a chute with a line of redstone coming off each side with repeaters. set one side to 1 tick delay and the other to 5 ticks delay. this will cook  and kill the chicken, but take the lava away before burning the loot, and because it only activates when something triggers the tripwire, servers won't flag it as a lag machine",0
